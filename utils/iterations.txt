CURRENT PROBLEMS:

BASIC LOGIC:
      - You cant cash out if you have not clicked any bombs
      - Bet resets after game over
      - Game automatically restarts after 3 secs
      - Put a 10% default bet

DESIGN:
      - Improve game over function
      - Start game at the bottom
      - Effects on certain actions




DEVELOPER LOGIC:
- Get central_gui reduced
-- Keep in cache the results of the multipliers so you dont have to recompute them
